## Task
- Rebuild the slider and CTA's below, as visible in the "design.png" file of this folder.
- Clicking one of the links to the right of the slider image should change the slider.
- Live website for an example of the functionality: https://www.grangewoodfencing.com/

- Use the Raleway font included in the index.html file instead of the font found on grangewoodfencing.com
- Use the closest matching Font Awesome icon where required. Font Awesome has been included in the index.html file, and you can search icons here - https://fontawesome.com/icons?d=gallery&p=2&m=free

## What we're looking for
- To see the build match the design as closely as possible
- The page to work responsively
- Use of valid semantic HTML

## Additional details
- jQuery has been included to make the slider functionality easier.
- Do not use any additional frameworks or libraries (we want to see your understanding of HTML and CSS without help).
- Do not change the design because you think you can improve it (this is what the client has asked for).
